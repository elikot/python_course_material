:UT Course Name:
    Data Analysis and Computational Methods with MATLAB

    (Enroll here, however, we will use Python_ instead of MATLAB)


The rapid changes we are witnessing with the internet revolution have
also changed the way scientists and engineers must perform their work.
Increasingly, the analysis of data requires basic programming skills;
skills that are too often self taught using inappropriate tools. 

This course provides students with hands on instruction on the use of
tools that are widely used by both scientists and leading technology
companies [1]_.  Importantly, students will follow a boot camp program
that has successfully introduced scientists and engineers to the art of
programming for over a decade [2]_.

The course will be run in two intensive two day segments.  The first
is an introduction to best practice programming with Python_, and the
second provides students with hands on instruction in IPython_ (to
produce visual and reproducible data analysis notebooks [3]_:sup:`,`
[4]_), matplotlib_ (to rapidly visualize data), Numpy_ + SciPy_ (an
extensive set of useful tools for data analysis), and SymPy_ (for
symbolic calculations). Following these, a small group project will
allow the students to demonstrate their new found superpowers.

All students will be required to bring a portable computer at all
times.  All required tools are freely available and will be provided
to the students in the form of a VirtualBox_ image for rapid
installation and to ensure all students will have the same
computational environment.  If the student has difficulty installing
VirtualBox_, the instructors will provide assistance.
