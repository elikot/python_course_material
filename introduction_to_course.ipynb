However, in current practice it is rare that source code is published along with computed results. Depending on the complexity of this code, the effect on the reader interested in reproducing the results ranges from minor annoyance to being completely blocked in their task. \n",
      "\n",
      "A number of editorials in high-profile journals have called for increased openness in computational sciences. Some prestigious journals, including Science, have even started to demand of authors to provide the source code for simulation software used in publications to readers upon request. \n",

      "**Replication** and **reproducibility** are two of the cornerstones in the scientific method. With respect to numerical work, complying with these concepts have the following practical implications:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Replication**: An author of a scientific paper that involves numerical calculations should be able to reproduce the results upon request. \n",

      "[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language.\n",
      "\n",
      "General characteristics of Python:\n",
      "----------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "* **clean and simple language:** Easy-to-read and intuitive code, easy-to-learn minimalistic syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects\n",
      "* **expressive language:** Fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical details:\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "* **dynamically typed:** No need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types.\n",
      "* **automatic memory management:** No need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays. No memory leak bugs. \n",
      "* **interpreted:** No need to compile the code. The Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advantages:\n",
      "-----------\n",
      "\n",
      "* The main advantage is ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
      "* Well designed language that encourage many good programming practices:\n",
      " * Modular and object-oriented programming, good system for packaging and re-use of code. This often results in more transparent, maintainable and bug-free code.\n",
      " * Documentation tightly integrated with the code.\n",
      "* A large standard library, and a large collection of add-on packages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disadvantages:\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "\n",
      "* Because Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed programming language, the execution of Python code can be slower compared to compiled statically typed programming languages, such as C and Fortran.  However, Python itself is written in C, so advanced Python developers can always make their code execute with C like efficiency.  \n",
      "* Somewhat decentralized, with different environments, packages, and documentation hosted in different places. This often makes it more difficult to get started."
